# react
library
based on component(code reusability)
singal page application
fast
only for view (no mvc concept)

why React ?
- virtual DOM => it becomes the fastest way to render data 

# react work on virtual Dom concept
- copy of actual dom which is saved in memory by react
- it updates on virtual DOM only when you add/update/delete any element from your DOM
- react maintains 2 copies of virtual Dom -> one is pre update and second is updated virtual DOM
